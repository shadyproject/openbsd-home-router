# Overview
This is a collection of configuration files for a home router running OpenBSD.  It is based on the above referenced article from [BSD Now](http://www.bsdnow.tv/) as well as [this guide from calomel.org](https://calomel.org/pf_config.html).

# Features
This router has the following features enabled:
* NAT
* DHCP
* Packet Filtering
* Static IPs for certain systems

There is currently support for PS4 voice and party chat.  

#Hardware
This configuration is more or less hardware agnostic.  The reference hardware I use is as follow:
* [Soekris Net-6501-50 Board](http://soekris.com/products/net6501-1/net6501-50-board.html)
* [Transcend 4GB SLC mSATA SSD](http://soekris.com/ssd-msata-4gb.html)
* [1 Slot Standard Case](http://soekris.com/net6501-50-board-case.html)
